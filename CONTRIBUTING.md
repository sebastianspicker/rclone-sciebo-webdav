# Contributing

Thanks for stopping by. Bug reports, ideas, and pull requests are all welcome.

## Getting set up

You need macOS or Linux with Bash 5.3+, [rclone](https://rclone.org) 1.69 or
newer, and curl. macOS ships Bash 3.2 as `/bin/bash`, so `brew install bash`
and make sure it is first on `PATH`. There is no build step: clone the
repository and run `bin/sciebo` straight from the checkout. `make lint` needs
`shellcheck` and `shfmt` and fails without them; set `LINT_ALLOW_MISSING=1`
to skip an absent linter locally (CI never does). `python3` is optional
(screenshot tool and a syntax check). None of these are runtime dependencies.

## What this codebase cares about

- **Bash 5.3+.** launchd/systemd start whichever bash `sciebo` was run with;
  `bin/sciebo` checks the running interpreter's version and refuses to start
  below 5.3, and `make lint`'s `check-bash` target does the same for the
  bash used to run the tooling.
- **No new dependencies.** The runtime is bash, rclone, and curl, used by the
  Login Flow, the capabilities probe, and the read-only `trash`/`versions`
  listings. Optional tools (`fzf`, linters) must stay optional, and there is
  no build step.
- **Commands stay independent.** Command modules return a status instead of
  calling each other; only `die` (exit 1) and `usage_error` (exit 2) exit
  directly. A command that needs another spawns `bin/sciebo`, it does not
  call it as a function.
- **New server-API commands start as extras.** A command that wraps a
  Nextcloud server feature is added with tier `extra` in
  `lib/cli/sciebo.spec` and listed under "Extra commands" in the CLI's
  usage output; it becomes `core` once the real-server contract suite covers
  it. `make lint` checks the two lists agree.
- **Credentials never get committed.** `.env` and
  `config/settings.local.env` are gitignored. Keep them that way, and don't
  paste real credentials or private sciebo URLs into issues.

## Where code goes

`lib/` is layered: `base` (no dependencies) → `adapters` (platform/HTTP/
keychain wrappers) → `config` (settings) → `state` (locks, run state) →
`sync` (policies, the sync engine) → `cli` → `commands` (one file per
subcommand). A lower layer never sources a higher one; `scripts/check-layers.sh`
(part of `make lint`) enforces the order. See
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for the full module map and for
how to add a new command.

## Before you open a pull request

```sh
make lint       # shellcheck + shfmt, the completions generator --check,
                # the layering check, plus a syntax check of the screenshot tool
make test       # unit + feature + integration tests, fully isolated from sciebo
make test-fast  # unit + feature tests only, skips integration (quicker pre-PR gate)
make test-one T=NAME   # run a single unit/feature test script by name
```

The unit tests only exercise libraries. The integration tests need `rclone`
and run the whole CLI against a throwaway `local` remote in a temp directory;
they never touch a real remote, your configuration, or launchd/systemd.

## Screenshots

The README and the [demo page](docs/index.html) show real CLI output rendered
to SVG. If you change user-visible output, refresh them:

```sh
make screenshots   # sandboxed run; writes docs/assets/screenshots/*.svg
```

This uses `rclone` and `python3` and talks to a temporary `local` remote, so
your real sciebo account is never involved.

## Shell completions

`completions/sciebo.bash`, `completions/_sciebo` (zsh), and
`completions/sciebo.fish` are generated from `lib/cli/sciebo.spec` (which
also generates `lib/cli/registry.sh`); edit the spec, then run `make gen` to
regenerate all four. `make lint` fails if the committed files drift from the
spec.

## Git hooks (optional)

`make hooks` opts into a repo pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) that
runs `shfmt` and `shellcheck` on staged files. It's optional; `make lint`
still runs everything before a merge either way.

## Style

- Keep changes small and focused, and say *why* in the commit message.
- Match the surrounding code, including the module comment at the top of each
  file.
- Run `make lint` before pushing; it is the formatting authority.
- Update the docs when behavior changes. If a claim in the README stops being
  true, that is a bug too.
